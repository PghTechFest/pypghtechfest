                  <p class="abstract-text">DevOps is a cultural movement that changes how we look at work, values the diversity of work done, supports acceleration of realized value, and measures the effect of social and technical change. How do we harness this very powerful force to instill or perpetuate behavior, systems, and culture within an organization? This talk will explore the underlying foundation of devops, demonstrate the framing of a narrative, and stories as a catalyst for positive change. </p>

                  <h4>Ryan Room - <b>Rust out your C</b> <i>Carol (Nichols || Goulding)</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">C code is famous for its speed but notorious for its segfaults. Rust is a systems programming language aiming to be a safe alternative to C, without sacrificing speed. Sounds great, right?? But what's that? You don't have time to rewrite everything right now?! No problem! Let's look at how to isolate pieces of a C library and replace them with Rust, preserving the current functionality but improving the safety and stability. See techniques for how to identify code that would be the next best rewrite candidate. Leave with the knowledge to start making incremental improvements to your legacy code using a state-of-the-art language.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 317 - <b>Herding the Cats: Client Management for the Rest of Us </b> <i>Nick  Stewart</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Clients, we all have them in one way or another.  Not only external clients, but managers, downstream partners, and even your team members are all forms of clients.  Managing these relationships, the expectations baked into them, while still creating top quality work is critical to both your success and the value your clients perceive in your work.  In this talk, we'll go over techniques to navigate failures, celebrate wins, and maintain effective communication allowing you to create a lasting professional relationship through which you can deliver the most value to your clients. </p>
                
                  <h4>Room 308 - <b>Why Does Automated Testing Fail?</b> <i>Joel Mason</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Many a well-meaning company has decided to undertake a large project to automate their tests.  After all, what could be better than having a computer do all that repetitive stuff instead of a highly paid tester?  Unfortunately, most of these projects end up resulting in brittle tests that provide minimal value and cost a lot to maintain.  Why does this happen?  In this talk we will look at several common pitfalls of automated testing and talk through an approach which allows a team to not only automate tests, but use them to drive high-quality development.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 310 - <b>The Alchemy of User Experience</b> <i>Benjamin Bykowski</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">al-che-my (noun) : any magical power or process of transmuting a common substance, usually of little value, into a substance of great value. The goal of the alchemist is to produce a Master Work by steadily improving the mind and the body. When seeking the best outcome in UX, there is hardly a difference. We'll explore the practice of using cyphers such as the Gestalt principles of design and the transmutation of base concepts like the Golden Ratio, and place what we find in our crucible of rapid prototypes. We'll consider what emerges as prophesied by agile usability testing and with some luck find the Elixir of Life contained in the UX Philosopher's Stone - a collection of tools and techniques for practicing UX Alchemy. One lucky apprentice will leave with a copy of Illuminate by Nancy Duarte.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 311 - <b>Performance Management in an Agile World</b> <i>Sudhir Thaikootathil    Jay Anderson</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Unfortunately, it’s not just the velocity that matters. It would really be much easier if it was all about velocity. As we know, working in an agile environment presents many challenges beyond how ‘fast’ a team is going. One of the most common is how to “manage performance” of individuals in agile teams. Most of the dreaded performance management systems focus on individual performance plans. As most of us know working in an agile environment is a team sport, therefore we need to reward based on team performance. We would all love to say that peer-to-peer accountability is the answer, however that really only goes so far in the case of individual performance management. No doubt, the goods and bads will have a light shined on them. The question, now that you are blinded by the light, what do you do next. We have found that it is often challenging to identify and coach your poor performers as well as reward and retain your high performers.

In this session we provide some tips and ideas on how to approach this</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 313 - <b>Be the Center of the Universe with REST &amp; ASP.NET Web API</b> <i>James Bender</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">RESTful services are the next big new, yet not so new thing. After years of dealing with SOAP Developers, Architects and even Users are looking for a simpler alternative for working with resources on the net. REST based services provide a simple and intraoperative way to use web services in everything from C to JavaScript. In this session you'll learn everything you need to know about designing and developing REST services. We'll discuss routing, HTTP verbs, return codes and designing service routes. You'll be shown some simple and free tools to help you develop and test your services and you'll learn how to quickly and easily create your own REST services (to return POX and JSON) in .NET using ASP.NET WebAPI.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 314 - <b>Property-Based Testing in JavaScript Using JSVerify</b> <i>Michael Gilliland</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Have you ever had production JavaScript bugs because of unexpected edge-cases? Have you written code that you _think_ but don't _know_ works? If that sounds like you, property-based testing with tools like JSVerify can help! Michael Gilliland will enlighten participants as to what property-based testing is, and provide examples of JSVerify in action. He will explain when property-based testing is appropriate and  where it fits with common testing practices.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 315 - <b>Azure Machine Learning for the Absolute Beginner</b> <i>Joel Cochran</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">In this talk we'll discuss the basics of the game changing field of Machine Learning. Along the way, we'll take a quick tour of Azure Machine Learning. Come see how you can go from zero to hero in a matter of hours!</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 316 - <b>Real-world microservices with Docker</b> <i>Chris Winters</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Getting your microservices deployed to the cloud is no easy task. Adding Docker to the mix makes a lot of hassles easier, but it adds a whole slew of new options and ways of thinking. When breaking down our application we learned about a lot of tradeoffs and how to stick most of the moving parts together. I'll break down what those parts are, demonstrate our chat-enabled build pipeline, show some of the pieces of our production environment, and share some lessons and experiences that might help you choose one platform or another.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 103 - <b>React Native To The Rescue</b> <i>Josh Gretz</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Users want their apps to be intuitive and enjoyable - seamlessly designed for the device in their hand. Developers want powerful tools that enable, encourage, and empower them to craft their vision into reality. Businesses want to reduce time to market, cost, and risk. In the world of mobile development, sadly these needs have been locked in conflict, inevitably leading to someone (or often everyone) losing. Although many tools have tried to answer the call, none have solved the problem without compromise. Either users grudgingly give up their native experience, developers are hindered by unfamiliar and subpar tools, or businesses are forced to spend more time and money while also increasing their risk. In the worst of cases, all three can happen, and as a community we need to do better.

React Native promises to answer these needs without the compromise. In this talk, we will explore how React Native empowers developers to create truly native apps that are delightful to use, while answering the real needs of business. Using the canvas of a cross platform app, we will walk through how React Native's approach enables quick and enjoyable development, reduces cost and complexity, and produces an experience with the same finesse as native development. Come see if React Native can rescue you from compromise.</p>

                  <h4>Ryan Room - <b>Deep Dive Into Chrome's DevTools</b> <i>Gabriel Obregon</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Most of us web developers have working knowledge on how to use Chrome's DevTools, but that is not enough. It is pretty common that after learning how to read the network tab, put a breakpoint, and inspect elements we stop there. Learning how to read a flame graph, use conditional breakpoints, look at stack traces, among a multitude of "little" tricks will shorten debugging time exponentially. A good understanding of DevTools allows developers to concentrate on writing code instead of spending hours debugging it. With this talk I will aim to get the audience to "level-up" and learn what a lot of us keep putting off to learn later.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 317 - <b>Why do I need to know how to write?</b> <i>Ronald Stone</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Software developers, engineers, and others of great technical prowess don’t need to know how to write well – they can just leave that to technical writers. Unfortunately, many of us believe this to some degree. In reality, situations arise every day in which the technically-savvy need to make others understand their ideas, and to do that, they need to be able to write clearly.  In this talk, we will discuss two styles of writing that excel at producing clear, concise communication - the Practical Style and the related Classic Style. The power of these styles comes from the distinct stand they take on the six elements of style – truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought and language.  Coupling these styles with the Inverted Pyramid format produces powerful and, most importantly, clear writing.

Of course, no one can become a polished writer in half-an-hour, so the lecture will include pointers to resources for independent study.

                  <h4>Room 310 - <b>Building "serverless" software with AWS Lambda</b> <i>Jonathan Knapp</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">I was asked to build a fuzzytext search interface for information stored in the SEC's massive Edgar database which holds all of the electronic documents filed with the SEC. By leveraging managed ElasticSearch, S3 for document storage, and the asynchronous job processing power of AWS Lambda I was able to build a solution that required absolutely no ongoing server maintenance for my client.

In this talk I'll explain how I was able to:

- parse gigabytes of info without IP activity restrictions
- provide an easy way to scale or disable the application
- continuously monitor parsing activity and application health

You will learn about the different services I utilized with their strengths and weaknesses as well as alternative services like Iron.io which allows you to write code in many different languages. I'll also talk about different ways async processing can be applied to other situations such as managing contact forms for static websites as FormKeep does.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 311 - <b>Delivering value with distributed scrum teams</b> <i>Gary Greenwood</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">The Holy Grail of agile organizations is highly functioning globally distributed teams.  In reality, this is difficult to achieve even with distributed teams in the same time zone.  In this talk we will cover common pain points with distributed teams and best practices to keep teams aligned and delivering with agility.

Topics covered include:
* Distributed Roles - When decision making needs to be centralized and how to plan for roadblocks
* Communication - How can we have a daily standup when the other half of the team is sleeping?  My product owner is in Australia and the dev team is in the US, how can this possibly work?
* Integrating the output of multiple teams - The build is broken and the developer who did the last check in won't be awake for 9 hours.
* How to keep morale high - Our teams have different cultures. A happy hour can't fix this.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 313 - <b>Rust for the rest of us</b> <i>John Downey</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Rust is a systems language pursuing the trifecta: safety, concurrency, and speed. It has come onto the stage from a rocky pre-1.0 era and is now ready to shine. The language has already started to show its power with the Mozilla Servo web browser engine. The goal is for you to walk away with a better understanding of the problems Rust is trying to solve and to get you thinking of where you may want to use it.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 314 - <b>Building A Package For Elixir</b> <i>Onorio Catenacci</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Onorio will discuss the ins and outs of building a Hex.pm package including but not limited to:

Creating docs
Using doctests to test your package and insure your documentation stays up to date
Pushing your package to Hex.pm
Pushing your package docs to Hex.pm</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 315 - <b>Coming Out Of Your Shell: A Comparison of *Nix Shells</b> <i>Kel Cecil</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Plenty of individuals have used the bash shell on Linux, Mac, or perhaps even a Cygwin environment. Many Linux and Mac developers are comfortable enough with bash to get our work accomplished, but perhaps there are alternatives that may make our command line work easier, faster, or more satisfying with features or characteristics that could be a better fit for how you work. This talk will take a high-level look at the features of the bash shell alongside zsh, fish, and more to give listeners an idea of where they might start when coming out of their shell.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 316 - <b>First, Let's Automate All The Lawyers: Smart Contracts With Ethereum</b> <i>Bill Laboon</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">For thousands of years, society has had contracts.  However - up until now - they were dependent upon people to enforce them.  Why not let computers do that work for us? With Ethereum, you can make cryptographically secure, self-executing smart contracts which enforce themselves; for example, transferring ownership of a car after a certain amount has been paid, or causing a loan to default if the amount of collateral drops below a specified value.  We'll see how blockchain technology can be generalized beyond simple currency exchange, and how to code your own contracts .</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 103 - <b>Of Bandwagons and Builds: Creating a Product with Ember 2.x</b> <i>Eli Flanagan</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">The front-end JavaScript framework buzz keeps droning. Sidestepping arguments over purity, what is it like to actually deliver a product with one? This talk will survey one team's experience with creating, maintaining, and delivering an Ember.js application while leveraging its entire ecosystem. Highlights and pitfalls will be addressed. The talk will also touch on implementing ember data, JSONAPI, tooling with ember-cli.</p>

                  <h4>Ryan Room - <b>Mind the Gaps...Or Finding the Stories You Need to Build the Product You Want</b> <i>Jeremy Jarrell</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">We've all been there.  We kick off a brand new project with a full backlog of perfectly defined user stories and start coding our way down the list.  It seems like we're making great progress until we near the end and start to see all of the gaps we've missed.  Maybe its that key report that has no data to fill it in.  Or maybe it's that killer feature that we spent so many hours on but isn't accessible from anywhere in the app.  Whatever they are, these are the gaps that keep our product from being complete.

In this hands-on session we'll learn the technique of Story Mapping which is designed to catch these gaps at the outset.  Rather than focusing on individual user stories and hope that they add up to a usable product, Story Mapping helps us understand the big picture of our product so we can be sure that not only are we capturing every story but that we're focusing on the right stories we need to build a great product.

Whether you're kicking off a new product from the ground up or just adding a few new features to an existing one, the skills you learn in this session will help you see the whole picture and deliver a great experience to your users.</p>

                  <p class="abstract-text">Murphy’s law is universal and constant, if something can go wrong it will go wrong.  This is especially true of distributed heterogeneous systems.  This talk will cover circuit breaker and bulkhead design patterns to build resilient systems and how they are applied within Netflix, one of the largest examples of a distributed system.  We will also cover how these patterns are applicable on a much smaller and relevant scale with live demos using the technology at Netflix.  Code and operational oversight aspects will be covered as well as tips for running micro service experiments locally.  </p>

                  <p class="abstract-text">With the recent release of the Angular 2 Beta, you’re probably asking if it’s worth it to make the jump from Angular 1. During this talk, we’ll share some tips and tricks on migration, as well as concepts that we learned along the way when migrating from Angular 1 to Angular 2. Wijmo has been developing controls in Angular 1 for quite some time now, and migrating our controls to the new Angular 2 beta was a pretty straightforward process.</p>

                  <p class="abstract-text">To provide a demonstration of using the Android plug-in for Gradle. Developing an Android application from scratch using only Gradle provides a deeper understanding of what is happening behind the scenes when developing in the Android Studio IDE. Gradle with it's Groovy-based DSL allows you to provide more advanced functionality and control over your mobile application (such as providing builds for different versions or devices, or use of various testing frameworks, etc.). Lastly, I will briefly discuss Android development using the Groovy Language. I will touch on the benefits and potential issues of using Groovy instead of Java (Optional subject depending on time length given). The knowledge gained from this presentation may be applied with or without the Android Studio IDE.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 311 - <b>Threads, Processes and the Death of Moore's Law</b> <i>Andre Henry</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Gone are the days when a single thread or process will max out out CPU capacity. More's Law is at its end and CPUs will only get more powerful with the addition of more cores. To take full advantage of these new processors computer programmers must understand multithreaded programming and the different models presented to us by our languages, frameworks and processors.  

We must understand processes, threads, cores, hyper-threads, native threads and green threads. The differences can be subtle and confusing but they are not difficult to understand. Understanding this technology is key to our high performance future. 

This talk will walk through the various threading models provided by common runtimes, we will also discuss the hardware that makes this possible. Leave with an understanding of cores and hyper threads, and learn differences between processes, threads and the 
various types of threads presented to us by the runtimes we use and how to take advantage of them.</p>

                  <p class="abstract-text">While we may all wish that every browser supported the latest web standards equally, the reality is very different. There are still many companies using older browsers, causing major testing headaches, not to mention the various modern desktop and mobile browsers. Cross-browser testing is a challenge too great for humans or computers alone. So don’t rely on one or the other! Join our session where we’ll discuss some of the key challenges of cross-browser testing, frameworks, and libraries that help mitigate cross browser issues, and provide insightful tips and techniques for hybrid cross-browser testing, with real-world examples.</p>

                  <p class="abstract-text">A talk about collaboration between UX and UI team members. It is pretty common for a UI developer to simply get designs from the UX designer to implement without much collaboration. This usually leads to developers not understanding the reasoning behind choices and the designer surprised when something was not implemented the way imagined. This talk will focus on how to improve communication and collaboration between the two practices and how to build trust between members. We will also discuss implementation techniques on both design and development sides to facilitate incremental development.</p>

                  <p class="abstract-text">The goal of this talk is to inspire developers to get into machine learning and apply their new skills to healthcare. I’ll briefly introduce machine learning. Then I will go over a few examples that show how OSS and open data can be used to promote life changing outcomes in healthcare.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 316 - <b>Pragmatic Process: Realistic Software Development Methods</b> <i>Richard Goforth</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">We all have a process when we write software.  Clearly that process affects the quality and the duration of the software, but it also affects our quality of life as a developer. 

This talk will focus on pieces of Agile methodologies and how to use them in real world scenarios. A series of practical actions that can improve the way you and your team build software.

Can the scrum meeting really be 5 minutes instead of 30?

What can I do so that I don't spend more time making tasks and tracking them than coding? 

How can I integrate bug fixing and new development into the same process? 

Why do I feel like I am always busy, and never getting anything done? 

Who makes my process better, and how does it get there?

All these and more so that you can be happier while you write better software.</p>

Where IronPython has fallen off as the .NET Python prodigal son Python for .NET has picked up the slack. Python for .NET (or pythonnet for short) is an integration of the C Python engine with .NET. We'll be going through the uses and methods of integration of Python with your .NET projects. Along with the uses and embedding of Python in .NET we'll also cover a quick comparison to IronPython.

                  <h4>Room 308 - <b>Lessons a tester learned when writing production code</b> <i>Anthony Lamorte</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Over the past few years the demand for, and discussion on the value of, the tester (or QA) that can write code have increased.  Typically, the role of the "coding tester" is to write test code and tools to help the team increase productivity without sacrificing quality.  What if a tester wrote production code?  In this presentation, I will review some of the lessons I learned, from a testers perspective, when writing code for a new feature.  Lessons that reinforced some talking points I've heard in the "coding tester" discussion, and debunked others.  Lessons that ultimately helped me, and hopefully can help you, be a better tester, better coder, and better teammate.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 310 - <b>Micro-datacenter chaos monkeys! Raspberry Pi &amp; Kubernetes</b> <i>Steve Sloka</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Kubernetes is a powerful, open source, container orchestration / cluster management tool created by Google. It draws upon all the lessons learned from a near-decade of using containers at Google. 
There are a number of tools available to spin up containerized environments with Docker on a single host and tear down just as fast. The difficulty is when trying to deploy across two or more servers. Kubernetes is solves just that problem by allowing you to manage a cluster of Linux containers as a single system.

This talk will outline container orchestration with a Kubernetes system leaving attendees with enough knowledge to spin up their own cluster and deploy at scale all while demonstrating real chaos monkey failure handling by pulling plugs from random nodes of a Raspberry Pi cluster.

                  <p class="abstract-text">Agile Coach. The title sounds so romantic, so exotic. It intimates that if you know the rules well enough then you have what it takes TO LEAD YOUR TEAMS TO VICTORY!!! Maybe. Maybe not. It takes a lot more than knowledge of agile principles and practices to lead teams to victory. If are ready to lay down your life for your fellow developers, product owners and scrum masters (even the ones that get on your last nerve) … well then maybe this is the career for you.</p>

                  <p class="abstract-text">Learn the fundamentals of Release Management, how it relates to DevOps, and benefits it and continuous deployment bring to any organization.  More specifically, I will present an overview of Release Management. I will also cover what Visual Studio Team Services and Team Foundation Services are. We will look at the new Cross-Platform build system, discuss DevOps practices, and benefits of Release Management. Walk away with the knowledge you need to get started with Release Management Team Services.</p>

                  <p class="abstract-text">Seattle's Parks and Recreation Department tasked my team with coming up with a way to get users' feedback on their experiences in the parks and recreation facilities in a scalable and we produced a solution using technology that's orders of magnitude cheaper than similar solutions that they have in place. All of this happened by virtue of a rockin' team, a streamlined design process, and a great microcontroller device. Sit in on this session to hear about our design, prototyping, and polyglot development processes, to see our latest iteration with its new hardware and software stack choices, and ALL OF THE LIGHTS. FLASHING LIGHTS. And yup, you guessed it: there will "Parks and Rec" gifs.</p>
                
                  <h4>Room 315 - <b>Functional Reactive Programming for Natural User Interface </b> <i>Riccardo Terrell</i></h4>
                  <p class="abstract-text">Functional reactive programming supports elegant programming of dynamic and reactive systems by providing first-class, composable abstractions for behaviors (time-varying values) and events (streams of timed values). Using Functional Reactive Programming to handle event-stream of values over time provides an alternative to the Observer pattern, which produces a series of unique responses to discrete changes in state. Reactive Programming is useful anywhere the Observer pattern is common, and provides an elegant way to express computation in domains such as video games, networking, user interfaces and simulation. Once understood, it can greatly simplify your project and code dealing with asynchronous events with nested callbacks, complex list filtering/transformation, or timing concerns. During this presentation I will create, consume and compose event streams with Observables introducing the concept of FRP integrating time flow and compositional events to build Natural User Interfaces with Kinect and Leap. You will walk away with the knowledge and excitement of how to use the Functional Reactive Programming approach and how to leverage the reactive programming power to build Natural User Interfaces.</p>

                  <p class="abstract-text">Composition is the sweet spot in programming. The longtime wisdom in the object-oriented community (for those willing to listen) has been "Favor composition over inheritance." Functional programming is fundamentally compositional, and so is the internet. This talk will use category theory to unpack the how and why of composition and argue we should wholeheartedly embrace it at all levels of abstraction. Don't worry if you are intimidated by abstract math; I am a category theory n00b myself and this is a practical examination rather than a deep dive.

                  <p class="abstract-text">Few things will ruin a great job faster than a bad hire, but there are very few resources to help you hire better. In fact, most programmers and hiring managers have little or no training in hiring programmers and just wing it. In this thought-provoking session, you'll learn that most advice for hiring programmers could be setting you up for failure because it is applicable to very few teams and organizations. You'll learn how to decide which programmer type is best for your project; the eight factors that reveal if a programmer will be a good fit for your team; how to talk about your project so it stands out from the crowd; and how to perform programmer interviews that are fun and revealing. This session will help you make your next teammate a great fit.</p>

                  <p class="abstract-text">As a marketer, I spend a lot of time talking about brands. Brand voice. Brand vision. Brand imaging. You can't throw an iPhone two feet at a blogger conference without hearing about someone's brand. But what nobody talks about when it comes to brand building is what happens at the moment of connection. That moment when someone chooses to share or subscribe or plus one or give your content a thumbs up. What's happening in that moment is empathy marketing at it's most pure. It's the start of a true relationship between the content creator and their audience, and it's the most valuable relationship a company - a brand - can build. Let's explore this openhearted marketing together though storytelling, personal experiences and - at the core of it all - vulnerability. </p>

Buildings are difficult to maintain and change. Software tends to change in unpredictable ways at unpredictable times. Perhaps it's time to change the comparison. Software development is more like gardening. In the fast-paced session, you'll learn the tools and techniques need to keep your software lush, green, and vibrant. Come and experience what many attendees have is the best session of the conference.

                  <p class="abstract-text">ElasticSearch has uses far outside the common use case of logging and searching. From integration with data science tools such as Spark or Hadoop for data analysis to real time anomaly detection, data associations, or matching, ElasticSearch has become the inverted-index for numerous use cases. In this talk we will explore several examples from data science - storing trained neural network for image recognition to find metadata on matched results of objects in images, to data processing on scale by filtering for anomalous data such as what Goldman Sachs demonstrated at ElastiCON{16}, to using ElasticSearch to find the best hotel or homes given a users preference.</p>

                  <p class="abstract-text">Git is great for storing our code. Git is fast and simple, it also contains many useful features such as versioning, branches, and blaming, but have you ever thought about using Git as a data store?

If your data is schema-less and you need to store versions, then Git may be the perfect data store for your data. Git provides you with easy ways pull down the data, look at different versions of this data, and even revert back to an old version of this data.

In this talk I will be talking about my experience actually using git as a data store. I will start by give an introduction to git, and some of the features that it offers. I will then talk about the benefits of storing schema-less data, with versioning. I will also talk about the trouble with scaling git. I will then talk about some of my real experience using git as a data store.

                  <p class="abstract-text">From the current trends in mobile app use and development, we can begin to predict where the future will take us. From these trends we begin to see that the future of mobile app development is three-fold: One - localization where the user believes the information is for them while development utilizes the same code to give the local information and flavor to the user. Two – private mobile apps for businesses will empower employees to be mobile, agile and responsive in sharing, acquiring and providing information to clients and managers. Three-businesses adding trust and legitimacy via their mobile apps. Through the presentation, we will examine trends in use, why certain apps are more popular than others and how to plan for the technological future of mobile apps.</p>
