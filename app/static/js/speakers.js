  Diversity is key. This is not only true for diversity measures like race, gender and age, but for diversity of job function, way of thinking and level of education. Direct user feedback is key, so is using non-technical staff as surrogates when that is not available. If you want to build something fast, build it with a group of like-minded people. If you want to build it well, bring in a diverse group for the whole process. (Design note: paper prototypes will save you).

Most implementations of Agile, especially in the enterprise, are no different.

      `We all know that time travel in inherently dangerous. Each trip must be planned precisely, and due to the speed at which the trip occurs, we can't adjust for problems mid-flight we have to have an automated flight plan. Timeline is a programming language developed to make it possible to do this safely, without having to write plans usinng the native machine-code of the time machine. Timeline is entirely event driven, since your flight plan must react to events that occur during your journey to the past. Timeline also discourages most idioms in legacy programming languages with an extreme focus on readability and clarity.

  <br />
  <br />

  Testing flight plans uses a risk-based approach. Instead of creating assertions about expected behavior, you specify the level of risk you are willing to tolerate and the simulator evaluates your flight plan to see if that risk is mitigated. This is unlike most legacy programming language test strategies, but paints a far more accurate picture of how the software will behave in practice.

      `The team at IBM Watson that designed and implemented the information retrieval components powering Watson Discovery Service took a microservices-first approach in which significant new business requirements were generally addressed by adding new components to the architecture. After one year, as individual components grew to be business critical, we paid off tech debt in what had become business critical components by combining some of them into a larger service. However, implementation details particular to those services were siloed in the minds of different developers who had, to some degree, forgotten them over time without having written documentation, and the emergent combined service suffered from performance problems that could have been foreseen if those individual pieces of knowledge had been surfaced and combined earlier. This could be called a form of "organizational forgetting" that can happen when an agile development team is working with a microservice architecture and when, as is common with agile development, internal documentation is sparse to nonexistent; in our case, the result was a significant nightly outage that took over a week to diagnose and solve.

My company was selling a great new product, but the process to push any update live for a single client involved six stakeholders and over a dozen brittle, manual steps. Even worse, many of these steps were personally executed by my boss, the head of our tech department, AKA, The One with the Most Valuable Time. Reflecting on the situation, my fear wasn't, What if this product tanks? It was, What if clients really want it? So, in my 10%-time, I took a step toward solving the problem: I automated my boss.

  <br />
  <br />

  This talk walks through how Meowifier was built, focusing on three aspects of the build that you might be surprised to learn were unique challenges.
  \n

  <br />
  <br />

  1. Finding a way to obtain the notes of only the melody from a song's audio file.
  No bass line or harmony muddying things, please. The melody is the principal part of a song. If you were listening to 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by _Queen_, the melody would be the part Freddy Mercury is singing. If you were to include the harmonies and bass parts in the meow-ified version, you wouldn't even recognize the resulting song because it would all sound jumbled together. Finding an API for song analysis and melody-extraction was surprisingly difficult.

  <br />
  <br />

  2. Correcting your meow length to match the length of the note in the melody.
  A melody is going to have notes of varying lengths. When you think back to 'Bohemian Rhapsody', Freddy doesn't hold each note for 0.5 seconds each. Some of them are .25 seconds or 0.125 seconds or even 1.5 seconds. But I can't have a meow folder containing meow files of every conceivable length. That would be a bloated monster of a library. Instead, I had to find a tool that could either cut or extend a meow to fill the proper amount of time.

  <br />
  <br />

  3. Creating a multi-octave library of meows.
  That's a lot of meows, and if you hadn't noticed, very few cats meow in the tenor, baritone, or bass ranges. And where does one hire a cat choir to begin with? So I had to make my own custom meow library using some interesting tactics. (If you're imagining me meowing into a microphone with a tuner in hand, for each imaginable meow note, you're not far off!)
