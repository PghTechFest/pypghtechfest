      <div class="tit-center col-md-10 mb-100">
        <p>
          All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following
          code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all
          participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

        <p>You have our contact details in the emails we've sent.</p>

        <h6>The Quick Version</h6>

        <p>
          Pittsburgh TechFest is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless
          of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
          size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of
          conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
          including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these
          rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the
          conference organisers.
        </p>

        <h6>The Less Quick Version</h6>

        <p>
          Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
          orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual
          images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
          sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
        </p>

        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

        <p>
          Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized
          images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
          clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem
          appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
          contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing
          branded t-shirts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide
          escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We
          value your attendance.
        </p>

        <p>
          We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social
          events.
