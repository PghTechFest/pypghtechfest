            <div class="welcome-text" style="text-align: left; margin: 40px 0 0 0">
                <p>Have you considered making the jump to working for yourself but you aren't sure where to start? Are you plagued by questions about running the day to day activities of your own business or are you terrified at the idea of finding customers or selling your services? Or, are you just stymied by how to handle everything that comes along with being self-employed such as finding healthcare, planning for retirement, or understanding your taxes?</p>

                <p>Regardless of your question, rest assured someone just like you has had to tackle the same challenge. In fact, they may even have some advice to help you. Whether you're building a product, providing consulting, or doing something in between, each member of our panel has been right where you are and are happy to share what they've learned.</p>

                <p>This panel will be comprised of local entrepreneurs, each of whom has built successful, product, consulting, or services businesses right here in Pittsburgh.  We'll begin a discuss of some of the most common questions new entrepreneurs have when making the leap. Then, we'll open the mic to the audience to give our panelists the opportunity to help with your questions.</p>

                <p>If you've always wanted to work for yourself but can't shake those last few burning questions, then come hear what our panelists have to say. You might find that the leap isn't quite as scary as you think.</p>
